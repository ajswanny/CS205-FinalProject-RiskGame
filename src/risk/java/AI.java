/*
    bool occupy; whether the territory has been occupied
    int terrSelect_prority; set southAmerica and Australia as 1, other continents as 0

    Strategy:
        1. AI will try to occupy southAmerica or Australia first, and place armies on the entry of
           the continents.
        2. AI will not attack players until they accumulate a specific number of armies. When defend, AI will
           always choose to roll two dices.
